# Sensor Dashboard Project

This is a **Sensor Dashboard** built with **React**, **Framer Motion** for animations, and **CSS** for styling. It fetches real-time sensor data (such as **Ozone**, **Temperature**, and **PM2.5**) and visualizes it in interactive charts. Health instructions and alerts are provided based on the data values.

## Features
- Real-time data visualization of **Ozone**, **Temperature**, and **PM2.5**.
- **Health Alerts** based on sensor readings, including **PM2.5** levels, **Ozone** concentration, and **Temperature**.
- Hover effects to display detailed information for each data point.
- Responsive design with animations for smooth transitions.
